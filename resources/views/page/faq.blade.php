					<h4>1. How much of my donation actually goes to a cause?</h4>
					<p>
						We can guarantee that no less than 85% of your donation will go directly to a cause. This leaves 15% to cover our operating costs; maintaining the website and mobile app, internet banking fees, marketing and administration costs.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, we’ll soon introduce ways where you can increase your impact from 85% to 110% of your out of pocket donation!
					</p>
					<h4>2. What is meant by an "out of pocket donation"?</h4>
					<p>
						An "out of pocket donation" is simply the amount you choose to donate via our online and mobile payment gateways. It excludes any donations you may receive from friends and family as a direct result of your online advocacy.
					</p>
					<h4>3. How can I give 110% of my out of pocket donation?</h4>
					<p>When you make a donation at weDonate.org you can double and even triple your donation by sharing it with your online social networks!					</p>
					<h4>4. How does that work?</h4>
					<p>It’s simple…</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Choose a cause!</li>
						<li>Choose an amount to donate!</li>
						<li>Share it with your social networks!</li>
						<li>When your friends and family join weDonate.org they’ll help contribute to your cause!</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>5. But why donate at weDonate.org when I can just donate to my favourite cause directly?</h4>
					<p>"When I donate and you donate together, weDonate more!"</p>
					<p>weDonate.org is an online social network for people who want to give more. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how you decide to donate, we’re just trying to give you maximum impact for minimum worry.					</p>
					<h4>6. Are my donations tax deductible?</h4>
					<p>No, not yet.</p>
					<p>But we’re not too far away from gaining Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status as a Public Ancillary Fund. This will allow us to distribute tax deductible receipts for donations intended for weDonate.org directly or cause with DGR Type 1.</p>
					<p>But we can back date any tax deductible donations so we’ll let you know once we’ve cut through the necessary red tape.</p>
					<h4>7. Why $7?</h4>
					<p>It’s coffee and a donut, it’s lunch, and it’s an amount we can all afford to donate per week!</p>
